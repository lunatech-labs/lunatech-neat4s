# NEAT4s

Neat4s is an implementation of the [Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) algorithm in Scala

NEAT is an evolutionary algorithm. Given a description of a minimal network (with the correct number of inputs and outputs and no hidden neurons) and a fitness function NEAT will find the least complex network topology which meets the requirements of the fitness function.

> This project is currently work-in-progress - the algorithm is broadly implemented as per the original paper but no experiments have been implemented to test it... yet...
